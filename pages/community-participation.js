              Social interaction and community engagement are essential parts of
              daily life. Thatâ€™s why we believe in supporting you to connect and
              participate in your own community each day. We work closely with
              you and your support networks to identify community-based
              activities you are most interested in doing, goals you would like
              to achieve and the best way to achieve them. From there, we design
              community participation programs that support you to reach those
              goals. Our priority is to ensure every activity aligns with your
              interests and is suitable for your current social and
              communication skills. These activities take place in the community
              and may be: Within a group One-to-one with Essence WA support
              worker. Our experienced staff are highly skilled in working with a
              diverse range of disabilities, including those with complex needs
              and are able to work with you and your loved ones to ensure all
              outings and activities meet your goals and needs.
